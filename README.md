**I just Googled what's on this shirt, but I have no idea what it means**

Feeling sneaky today, huh? This shirt is a fun, quirky thing made by [Spatie](https://spatie.be). We build web applications, courses & open source packages for Laravel.

**I like the shirt, but they are not so good for drinking coffee out of. Do you have a solution for that?**

It's your lucky day, buddy! We have an equally hilarious, witty and clearly made for laughs mug that you can also find in [our merch store](https://spatie.myspreadshop.net/spatielaravel-mug-A6712584808188e2f1cd96a64?productType=1134&sellable=1XN4a883Zgi4gbNeVQkQ-1134-32&appearance=2&size=29).
